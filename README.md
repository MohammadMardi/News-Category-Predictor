# News Category Predictor: Automatic Classification of [Tasnim News](https://www.tasnimnews.com) Dataset Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Description

A project for automatic news classification into different topics using machine learning algorithms on the [Tasnim News](https://www.tasnimnews.com) dataset. This project utilizes several machine learning techniques including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest to accurately classify news articles into predefined categories.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the news articles for classification.
- **Model Training**: Using various machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models with accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
- **Prediction**: Classifying new articles into predefined categories.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [TasnimNews Dataset (Farsi - Persian) | تسنیم](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirpourmand/tasnimdataset).
